everybody knows that you only sandwood with the grain but is everybody wrong the answer is

1
00:00:05,728 --> 00:00:09,024
kind of yeah only standing wood with the grain is sort of a holdover from the

2
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,512
old days when we had a handstand everything and in the case of hand standing yes

3
00:00:12,607 --> 00:00:16,799
you only want to go with the grain either with just that she to sandpaper or

4
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:21,375
with something like these standing blocks like we've all probably used however just like everything else

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,568
in the world there's been advancements in technology and now most of us have something called

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,920
a random orbital sander if you think about how a random orbital sander works it will

7
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:33,791
make sense pretty quick why you don't necessarily need to go with the grain a random

8
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:38,495
orbell center will vibrate in random directions it will also spin the entire time you operate

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,431
it meaning that even if you're going with the grain that spinning action is actually hitting

10
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:48,000
the grain from every possible direction including with it across at diagonal every possible direction so

11
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,903
you don't necessarily need to go with the grain in fact I try to mix up

12
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:56,352
my standing pattern going with it across it diagonal and really just mixing at my pattern

13
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:56,832
altogether
